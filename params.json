  "body": "### Overview\r\n[MendelBase](https://github.com/OpenMendel/MendelBase.jl) is a utility package that contains the base functions of [OpenMendel](https://openmendel.github.io). It provides the information needed to process keywords and read data from external files. MendelBase is necessary to run any analysis package, and you should install MendelBase first, before you install the other packages.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nWithin Julia, use the package manager to install MendelBase:\r\n\r\n    Pkg.clone(\"git@github.com:OpenMendel/MendelBase.jl.git\")\r\n\r\nThis package supports Julia v0.4.\r\n\r\n### Input Files\r\nTo make your genetic data available to OpenMendel, the various input files must be in a format\r\nthat OpenMendel can read. To provide OpenMendel with the information it needs to perform its analysis you must prepare the following files. (An analysis option won't always need every file type.)\r\n\r\n* [Control File](#control-file): Specifies the names of your data input and output files and any optional parameters (*keywords*) for the analysis. (For a complete list of keywords, see [Keywords Table](#keywords-table) below).\r\n* [Locus File](#locus-file): Names and describes the genetic loci in your data.\r\n* [Pedigree File](#pedigree-file): Gives information about your individuals, such as name, sex, family structure, and ancestry.\r\n* [Phenotype File](#phenotype-file): Lists the available phenotypes.\r\n* [SNP Definition File](#snp-definition-file): Defines your SNPs with information such as SNP name, chromosome, position, allele names, allele frequencies. This may be a PLINK .bim format file.\r\n* [SNP Data File](#snp-data-file): Holds the genotypes for your data set. Must be a standard binary PLINK .bed file in SNP major format. If you have a SNP data file you must have a SNP definition file.\r\n\r\n### Control files<a id=\"control-file\"></a>\r\nThe format of the Control file is\r\n\r\n\tKeyword = Keyword_Value(s)\r\n\r\nBelow is an example Control file to run GWAS (text after \"#\" is commented out):\r\n\r\n\t#\r\n\t# Input and Output files.\r\n\t#\r\n\tplink_input_basename = gwas 1 data\r\n\toutput_file = gwas 1 Output.txt\r\n\tmanhattan_plot_file = ManPlotOutput_1.png\r\n\t#\r\n\t# Analysis parameters.\r\n\t#\r\n\tregression = linear\r\n\tregression_formula = Trait ~ Sex\r\n\r\nIn the example above, there are five keywords. The first three specify input and output files: *plink_input_basename*, *output_file*, *manhattan_plot_file*. The last two specify analysis parameters: *regression* and *regression_formula*. The text after the '=' are the keyword values. For keywords that can take a set of values, list the values separated by commas.\r\n\r\n### Keywords<a id=\"keywords-table\"></a>\r\nThis is a list of the general OpenMendel keywords common to most analysis package. The keywords specific to an analysis package are covered in detail in the documentation for each package.\r\n\r\n Keyword          |   Default     |   Allowed Values     |  Short Description\r\n----------------  |  ----------------  |  ----------------  |  ----------------\r\naffected_designator  |  affected  |  10 Characters  |  Disease phenotype designator\r\nallele_pseudo_count  |  0.1  |  Real  |  Number of prior alleles or haplotypes\r\nallele_separator  |  / and \\  |  1 Character  |  Separates codominant alleles.

First character is used in output \r\noutput_file  |  Mendel_Output.txt  |  1024 Characters  |  Name of standard output file\r\npedigree_file  |    |  1024 Characters  |  Name of input pedigree file\r\nphenotype_file  |    |  1024 Characters  |  Name of input phenotype file\r\nplink_input_basename  |    |  1024 Characters  |  Name of plink input basename file\r\nplink_output_basename  |    |  1024 Characters  |  Name of plink output basename file\r\npopulations  |  Set{ASCIIString}()  |  Integer  |  Number of populations\r\nproduct_mode  |  TRUE  |  TRUE, FALSE  |  \r\nseed  |  1234  |  Integer  |  Random number generator seed\r\nsnpdata_file  |    |  1024 Characters  |  Name of input snpdata file\r\nsnpdefinition_file  |    |  1024 Characters  |  Name of input snpdefinition_file\r\ntrait  |    |    |  \r\nxlinked_analysis  |  FALSE  |  TRUE, FALSE  |  Whether or not markers are on the X chromosome\r\n\r\n### Locus File<a id=\"locus-file\">\r\n\r\nThe Locus File must have a header row with the fieldnames (in any order): Locus, Allele, Chromosome, Frequency. If your samples come from different populations, instead of one column lableled Frequency, name the populations in the control file with the keyword *populations*, and give a frequency for each population, where the fieldnames are the population names specified in the control file. The population frequencies need not sum to 1, but will be normalized to 1 in the analysis.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n\tLocus,Allele,Chromosome,Basepairs,FemaleMorgans,MaleMorgans,European,African,Chinese\r\n\tABO,A,9,10,0.0,0.0,0.27,0.18,0.19\r\n\tABO,B,9,10,0.0,0.0,0.06,0.11,0.17\r\n\tABO,O,9,10,0.0,0.0,NA,0.71,0.64\r\n\tRh,D,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.61,0.81,1.0\r\n\tRh,d,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.39,0.19,0.0\r\n\tSNP,1,9,0,0.2,0.1,NA,NA,NA\r\n\tSNP,2,9,0,0.2,0.1,NA,NA,NA\r\n\t\r\n### Pedigree File<a id=\"pedigree-file\">\r\n\r\nA Pedigree file is always required. It can be in PLINK FAM file format, in which case it must have the extension .fam, or it can have the format of a required header rows with the following fieldnames (in any order): Pedigree,Person,Mother,Father,Sex,Twin, and optional columns such as population ancestries. The fractional ancestries need not sum to 1, but will be normalized to 1 in the analysis.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n\tPedigree,Person,Mother,Father,Sex,Twin,BirthYear,Politician,European,African,Chinese,ABO,Rh,Xg,XSNP,HtMeters\r\n\tClinton,Bill,,,male,0,1946.0,true,1.0,0.0,0.0,A,+,+,2/2,1.88\r\n\tClinton,Hillary,,,female,0,1947.0,true,1.0,0.0,0.0,O,-,-,1/1,NA\r\n\tClinton,Chelsea,Hillary,Bill,female,0,1980.0,false,NA,NA,NA,A,+,-,1/2,NA\r\n\tObama,Barack,,,male,0,1961.0,true,0.5,0.5,0.0,O,+,NA,1/1,1.85\r\n\tObama,Michelle,,,female,0,1964.0,false,0.3,0.7,0.0,B,+,NA,2/2,NA\r\n\tObama,Malia,Michelle,Barack,female,0,1998.0,false,NA,NA,NA,O,-,+,1/2,NA\r\n\tObama,Sasha,Michelle,Barack,female,0,2001.0,false,NA,NA,NA,B,+,+,1/2,NA\r\n\r\n### Phenotype File<a id=\"phenotype-file\">\r\n\r\nFormat\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n\tLocus,Phenotype,Genotypes\r\n\tABO,A,\"A/A,A/O\"\r\n\tABO,B,\"B/B,B/O\"\r\n\tABO,AB,\"A/B\"\r\n\tABO,O,\"O/O\"\r\n\tRh,+,\"D/D,D/d\"\r\n\tRh,-,\"d/d\"\r\n\tXg,+,\"+/+,+/-\"\r\n\tXg,-,\"-/-\"\r\n\r\n###SNP Definition File<a id=\"snp-definition-file\">\r\n\r\nDefines your SNPs with information such as SNP name, chromosome, position, allele names, allele frequencies.
