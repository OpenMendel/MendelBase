  "body": "### Overview\r\n[MendelBase](https://github.com/OpenMendel/MendelBase.jl) is a utility package that contains the base functions of [OpenMendel](https://openmendel.github.io). It provides the information needed to process keywords and read data from external files. MendelBase is necessary to run any analysis package, and you should install MendelBase first, before you install the other packages.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nWithin Julia, use the package manager to install MendelBase:\r\n\r\n    Pkg.clone(\"git@github.com:OpenMendel/MendelBase.jl.git\")\r\n\r\nThis package supports Julia v0.4.\r\n\r\n### Input Files\r\nTo make your genetic data available to OpenMendel, the various input files must be in a format\r\nthat OpenMendel can read. To provide OpenMendel with the information it needs to perform its analysis you must prepare the following files. Examples input files can be found in the docs subfolders of the analysis packages. (An analysis option won't always need every file type.)\r\n\r\n* [Control File](#control-file): Specifies the names of your data input and output files and any optional parameters (*keywords*) for the analysis. (For a list of common keywords, see [Keywords Table](#keywords-table) below).\r\n* [Locus File](#locus-file): Names and describes the genetic loci in your data.\r\n* [Pedigree File](#pedigree-file): Gives information about your individuals, such as name, sex, family structure, and ancestry.\r\n* [Phenotype File](#phenotype-file): Lists the available phenotypes.\r\n* [SNP Definition File](#snp-definition-file): Defines your SNPs with information such as SNP name, chromosome, position, allele names, allele frequencies. This may be a PLINK .bim format file.\r\n* [SNP Data File](#snp-data-file): Holds the genotypes for your data set. Must be a standard binary PLINK .bed file in SNP major format. If you have a SNP data file you must have a SNP definition file.\r\n\r\n### Control files<a id=\"control-file\"></a>\r\nThe Control file is a text file consisting of keywords and their assigned values. The format of the Control file is:\r\n\r\n\tKeyword = Keyword_Value(s)\r\n\r\nBelow is an example Control file to run Gamete Competition (text after \"#\" is ignored, and treated as comments):\r\n\r\n\t#\r\n\t# Input files.\r\n\t#\r\n\tlocus_file = gamete competition LocusFrame.txt\r\n\tpedigree_file = gamete competition PedigreeFrame.txt\r\n\t#\r\n\t# Analysis parameters.\r\n\t#\r\n\tdisease_status = ACE\r\n\taffected_designator = 1\r\n\tstandard_errors = true\r\n\r\nIn the example above, there are five keywords. The first three specify input and output files: *plink_input_basename*, *output_file*, *manhattan_plot_file*. The last two specify analysis parameters: *regression* and *regression_formula*. The text after the '=' are the keyword values. For keywords that can take a set of values, the values are separated by commas.\r\n\r\n### Keywords<a id=\"keywords-table\"></a>\r\nThis is a list of the general OpenMendel keywords common to most analysis package. The keywords specific to an analysis package are covered in detail in the documentation for each package. The names of keywords are *not* case sensitive. (The keyword values *may* be case sensitive.)\r\n\r\n Keyword          |   Default Value    | Allowed Values |  Short Description       \r\n----------------  |  ----------------  |  ----------------  |  ----------------\r\naffected_designator  |  affected  |    |  Disease phenotype designator\r\nallele_pseudo_count  |  0.1  |  Real  |  Number of prior alleles or haplotypes\r\nallele_separator  |  /  |  1 Character  |  Separates codominant alleles\r\ncomplexity_threshold  |  5.00E+07  |  Real  |  Criterion for not analyzing pedigrees\r\ndisease_status  |    |    |  Name of column designating disease status\r\neliminate_genotypes  |  FALSE  |  TRUE, FALSE  |  Whether or not genotypes are eliminated\r\nfemale  |  \"female\", \"f\", 'f', \"2\", '2', 2  |   Female designators separated by commas  |  Female designators\r\nfield_separator  |  ','  |  1 Character  |  Character used to separates values in data files\r\ngenetic_map_function  |  Haldane   |   Haldane or Kosambi    |  Genetic map units\r\nlocus_file  |    |    |  Name of input locus file\r\nlump_alleles  |  FALSE  |  TRUE, FALSE  |  Whether or not alleles are combined\r\nmale  |  \"male\", \"m\", 'm', \"1\", '1', 1  |  Male designators separated by commas  |  Male designators\r\nnew_pedigree_file  |    |    |  OpenMendel generated output pedigree file\r\nordered_allele_separator  |  \\| (vertical bar) |  1 Character  |  Separates ordered codominant alleles \r\noutput_file  |  Mendel_Output.txt  |    |  Name of standard results output file\r\npedigree_file  |    |     |  Name of input pedigree file\r\nphenotype_file  |    |    |  Name of input phenotype file\r\nplink_input_basename  |    |    |  Basename of PLINK input files\r\nplink_output_basename  |    |    |  Basename of PLINK output files\r\npopulations  |    |  Names of populations separated by commas  |  Names of populations\r\nproduct_mode  |  TRUE  |  TRUE, FALSE  |  \r\nseed  |  1234  |  Integer  |  Random number generator seed\r\nsnpdata_file  |    |    |  Name of input SNP data file\r\nsnpdefinition_file  |    |    |  Name of input SNP definition_file\r\n\r\n### General Data File Format\r\nAll data files are in text file format with one exception: if you have dense SNP data, the SNP data should be in binary files in PLINK *BED* file format. OpenMendel will also accept [PLINK format](http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/data.shtml) *FAM* and *BIM*. All non-PLINK OpenMendel data files list data in columns, with a header row with field names for each column. The column need not be in any fixed order. Many column headers have required, case sensitive names. The column separators can be any single character, specified in the control file with the *field_separator*. The default separator is *comma*. If a data element contains the field separator (e.g. comma) it must be enclosed in double quotes, or it will be read as a new field. Missing data is blank (\"\") or \"NA\". The PLINK file missing data symbols are \"0\" or \"-9\".\r\n\t\r\n### Pedigree File<a id=\"pedigree-file\">\r\nA Pedigree file is always required. OpenMendel will accept [PLINK format](http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/data.shtml) *FAM* Pedigree files, in which case the file must have the extension *.fam*. The OpenMendel Pedigree file format has a header row with the following required field names (in any order): Pedigree,Person,Mother,Father,Sex,Twin. The only required column is one labeled either *“Individual”* or *“Person”*, giving the samples names. Each individual must either have *both* and mother *and* a father, or both mother and father must be blank. If the mother and father are missing, the individual is treated as a founder. If the Pedigree column is missing, the data is treated as separate pedigrees of size one, and all individuals are unrelated. Within each pedigree, every person must have a unique name. If a set of individuals in the same pedigree all have the same (non-blank) value in the *\"Twin\"* field they are all considered monozygotic (MZ) siblings. If the sex field is missing, all individuals are treated as female. If a sex field exists but the sex is missing for an individual, that individual is  treated as female. If the analysis uses a [Locus file](#locus-file) to describe the markers, the genotypes are contained in the Pedigree file, and the marker names in the Locus and Pedigree files must agree. If the analysis uses a [SNP Definition file](#snp-definition-file) to describe the markers, the genotypes are contained in the [SNP Data file](#snp-data-file). The Pedigree file may also include optional columns such as traits and [population](#<a id=\"populations\">) ancestries.\r\n\r\n**Example Pedigree File**\r\n\r\n\tPedigree,Person,Mother,Father,Sex,Twin,ABO,HtMeters\r\n\tClinton,Bill,,,male,0,A,1.88\r\n\tClinton,Hillary,,,female,0,O,NA\r\n\tClinton,Chelsea,Hillary,Bill,female,0,A,NA\r\n\tObama,Barack,,,male,0,O,1.85\r\n\tObama,Michelle,,,female,0,B,NA\r\n\tObama,Malia,Michelle,Barack,female,0,O,NA\r\n\tObama,Sasha,Michelle,Barack,female,0,B,NA\r\n\r\n### Phenotype File<a id=\"phenotype-file\">\r\n\r\nFormat\r\n\r\n**Example Phenotype File**\r\n\r\n\tLocus,Phenotype,Genotypes\r\n\tABO,A,\"A/A,A/O\"\r\n\tABO,B,\"B/B,B/O\"\r\n\tABO,AB,\"A/B\"\r\n\tABO,O,\"O/O\"\r\n\tRh,+,\"D/D,D/d\"\r\n\tRh,-,\"d/d\"\r\n\tXg,+,\"+/+,+/-\"\r\n\tXg,-,\"-/-\"\r\n\r\n### Locus File<a id=\"locus-file\">\r\nThe Locus file defines your genetic markers if you are working with a relatively small number of markers. If you have a dense SNP map you should use a [SNP Definition file](#snp-definition-file) to define your SNPs. The Locus file must have a header row with the field names (in any order): *Locus, Allele, Chromosome, Frequency*. You may also include locus position information with optional the fields *Morgans*, *FemaleMorgans* and *MaleMorgans*, and *Basepairs*. For each locus there will be one line per locus allele.\r\n\r\n**Example Locus File**\r\n\r\n\tLocus,Allele,Chromosome,Frequency\r\n\tABO,A,9,0.64,0.27\r\n\tABO,B,9,0.34,0.06\r\n\tABO,O,9,1.35,NA\r\n\tRh,D,1,2.42,0.61\r\n\tRh,d,1,0.58,0.39\r\n\tSNP,1,9,0,NA\r\n\tSNP,2,9,0,NA\r\n\r\n###SNP Definition File<a id=\"snp-definition-file\">\r\nThe SNP Definition file defines your SNPs with information such as SNP name, chromosome, position, and allele names. OpenMendel will accept [PLINK format](http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/data.shtml) *BIM* Pedigree files, in which case the file must have the extension *.bim*. The OpenMendel SNP Definition file format has a header row with the field names: *SNP* or *Locus* (if this column is absent the SNPs are named 1,2,3..n); Chromosome (1-22,x; if column is absent assumed autosomal); Locus, CentiMorgans (if column is absent uses 0); Basepairs (if column is absent uses 0); Allele1, Allele2 = allele names. If allele names are absent OpenMendel uses \"1\" for Allele1 and \"2\" for Allele2.\r\n\r\n**Example SNP Definition File**\r\n\r\n\tChromosome,Locus,CentiMorgans,Basepairs,Allele1,Allele2\r\n\tX,rs311165,0,2699555,C,A\r\n\tX,rs28579419,0,2699645,T,G\r\n\tX,rs2306736,0,2700027,C,T\r\n\tX,rs5939320,0,2700202,A,G\r\n\tX,rs4892819,0,2700613,G,A\r\n\tX,rs5982853,0,2702143,C,T\r\n\tX,rs73433431,0,2702698,T,C\r\n\r\n###SNP Data File<a id=\"snp-data-file\">\r\nSNP Data file holds the SNP genotypes for your data set. The SNP Data file must be a standard [PLINK format](http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/data.shtml) binary *BED* file in SNP major format. If you have a SNP data file you must have a SNP definition file, but it does not need to be PLINK format. (There is no example SNP Data file because the SNP Data file is a binary file, and not human readable.\r\n\r\n###PLINK Basename\r\nYou may use the keyword *plink_input_basename* in the Control file to specify a name for your PLINK format files. If you use this keyword, you must supply 3 PLINK files with that name: *your_basename.bed* (SNP data file), *your_basename.bim* (SNP definition file), and *your_basename.fam* (pedigree file).\r\n\r\n### Populations<a id=\"populations\">\r\nIf your individuals are of mixed ethnicity, and thus have fractional ancestry, OpenMendel will allow you to adjust for this in your analysis by using the *populations* keyword. Your populations will be named in your control file, fractional ancestries assigned to your individuals in the Pedigree file](#pedigree-file), and population specific allele frequencies assigned to markers in your [Locus file](#locus-file).\r\n\r\nFor example, your [Control file](#control-file) might look like this:\r\n\r\n\t# Input and Output files.\r\n\t#\r\n\tlocus_file = genedropping LocusFrame.txt\r\n\tpedigree_file = genedropping PedigreeFrame.txt\r\n\tphenotype_file = genedropping PhenotypeFrame.txt\r\n\tnew_pedigree_file = genedropping NewPedigreeFrame.txt\r\n\toutput_file = genedropping Output.txt\r\n\t#\r\n\t# Analysis parameters for GeneDropping option.\r\n\t#\r\n\trepetitions = 2\r\n\tpopulations = European, African, Chinese\r\n\t\r\nYour [Pedigree file](#pedigree-file) would have a column for each population, with a fractional ancestry assigned. The fractional ancestries need not sum to 1, but will be normalized to 1 in the analysis.\r\n\r\nAn example [Pedigree file](#pedigree-file) might look like this:\r\n\r\n\tPedigree,Person,Mother,Father,Sex,Twin,European,African,Chinese,ABO\r\n\tClinton,Bill,,,male,0,1,0,0,A\r\n\tClinton,Hillary,,,female,0,1,0,0,O\r\n\tClinton,Chelsea,Hillary,Bill,female,0,NA,NA,NA,A\r\n\tObama,Barack,,,male,0,0.5,0.5,0,O\r\n\tObama,Michelle,,,female,0,0.3,0.7,0,B\r\n\tObama,Malia,Michelle,Barack,female,0,NA,NA,NA,O\r\n\tObama,Sasha,Michelle,Barack,female,0,NA,NA,NA,B\r\n\r\nYour [Locus file](#locus-file), instead of one column labeled *Frequency*, would have a frequency column for each population, where the header for the column is the name of that population. give an allele frequency for each population. The population frequency field names are the population names specified in the control file. In the example Locus file below, the Control file would include the line *\"populations = European,African,Chinese\"*. The population frequencies need not sum to 1, but will be normalized to 1 in the analysis. \r\n\r\nAn example [Locus file](#locus-file) might look like this:\r\n\r\n\tLocus,Allele,Chromosome,European,African,Chinese\r\n\tABO,A,9,0.27,0.18,0.19\r\n\tABO,B,9,0.06,0.11,0.17\r\n\tABO,O,9,NA,0.71,0.64\r\n\r\n### Output Files\r\nAll OpenMendel analysis options will create a results file. If no name is for this file is specified in the [Control](#control-file), it will be given the default name Mendel_Output.txt. A number of OpenMendel options give you the option of creating output files, such as plot files, or new pedigree, locus, or SNP input files based on the analysis results. These newly created input files can be used in subsequent analysis runs. To create these files, the file type is specified by a keyword in the control file, and a filename may be specified.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n\t#\r\n\t# Input and Output files.\r\n\t#\r\n\tplink_input_basename = gwas 1 data\r\n\toutput_file = gwas 1 Output.txt\r\n\tmanhattan_plot_file = ManPlotOutput_1.png\r\n\t#\r\n\t# Analysis parameters for GWAS option.\r\n\t#\r\n\tregression = linear\r\n\tregression_formula = Trait ~ Sex\r\n\r\n\r\n### Citation\r\n\r\nIf you use this analysis package in your research, please cite the following reference in the resulting publications:\r\n\r\n*Lange K, Papp JC, Sinsheimer JS, Sripracha R, Zhou H, Sobel EM (2013) Mendel: The Swiss army knife of genetic analysis programs.
